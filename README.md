# Baldessari Neverending

A little internet art project that generates endless John Baldessari spot paintings by sourcing images from Flickr and using Computer Vision to spot faces. 

I am using Streamlit to host the python script so that it runs in-browser.

### How to run it on your own machine

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
